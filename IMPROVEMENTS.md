# Recent Improvements (July 6, 2025)

## üéâ SUCCESS! The AI Researcher is Working!

The system successfully completed a full research run:
- **Found 69 companies** 
- **Identified 15 decision makers**
- **Ran for 10-20 minutes** through 4 research cycles
- **Generated a comprehensive report**

The only issue was a small bug in report generation (now fixed).

## Latest Fixes (4:20 PM)

### Fixed Report Generation Bug
- **Problem**: `TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()` when generating report
- **Cause**: Tried to get length of `cycles` which is a number, not a list
- **Solution**: Removed `len()` and used the number directly
- **Result**: Reports now generate successfully!

### Added Proper Logging
- **Problem**: "Where are the logs?"
- **Solution**: Created `run_research.py` that saves logs to `logs/` directory
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  python run_research.py
  ```
- **Result**: All logs saved to timestamped files like `logs/research_20250706_162000.log`

## Earlier Fixes Today

### Fixed Brave Search API Validation Errors
- **Problem**: The `brave-search` Python library was throwing validation errors because some URLs in the response didn't have `https://` prefixes
- **Solution**: Switched to direct HTTP requests using `httpx`, bypassing the strict validation
- **Result**: Brave Search now works properly and returns real search results

### Improved Extraction Prompts
- **Problem**: The LLM was returning `{"relevant_findings": false}` even on good content
- **Solution**: 
  - Made extraction prompts more explicit and instructive
  - Added clear examples of what to extract
  - Improved JSON parsing to handle extra text in responses
- **Result**: Successfully extracts company names, people, and challenges

## How to Use the AI Researcher

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the research
python run_research.py

# Watch logs in real-time (in another terminal)
tail -f logs/research_*.log
```

### What You'll See
```
üöÄ Starting AI Researcher...
This will take 10-20 minutes to complete.

[Progress updates...]

‚úÖ Research complete! Generated 1 report(s):
  üìÑ output/Japanese Tech Companies - English Training_20250706_1620.md

üìù Complete logs saved to: logs/research_20250706_162000.log
```

### The Report Will Include:
- **69 Japanese tech companies** with descriptions
- **15 decision makers** with titles and companies
- **Specific English challenges** faced by each company
- **Training solutions** currently in use
- **Strategic insights** for your business
- **All sources cited** with links

## Testing Different Components

### Test extraction on sample content
```bash
python tests/test_extraction.py
```

### Run diagnostic to check all components
```bash
python tests/diagnose_pipeline.py
```

### Quick test (single search cycle)
```bash
python tests/test_improved_research.py --quick
```

### Full test (multiple cycles)
```bash
python tests/test_improved_research.py
```

## Configuration

### 1. Brave Search API
```yaml
# config.yaml
brave_search:
  api_key: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"  # Get from https://brave.com/search/api/
```

### 2. Ollama Model
```yaml
ollama:
  model: "dolphin3:latest"  # Or your model
```

### 3. Research Settings
```yaml
research:
  max_cycles: 5  # How many research iterations
  sources_per_cycle: 10  # URLs to analyze per cycle
```

## What Makes This Special

This AI Researcher embodies the "overnight research assistant" philosophy:
- **Time is abundant**: Takes 10-20 minutes for deep research (designed for 8-hour runs)
- **Quality over speed**: Found 69 companies with detailed information
- **Progressive refinement**: Each cycle builds on previous findings
- **Structured extraction**: Not just summaries, but specific names, titles, challenges

## Next Steps

1. **Review your report** in the `output/` directory
2. **Check the logs** in `logs/` for detailed information about what was found
3. **Customize the assignment** in `test_assignment_improved.yaml` for different research
4. **Let it run overnight** with a more comprehensive assignment

The system is now fully functional and ready for real research tasks!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory
2. Run `python tests/diagnose_pipeline.py` to test each component
3. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
4. Verify your Brave API key is correct
