# Recent Improvements (July 6, 2025)

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. **Content Extraction Fixed**
- **Before**: Only analyzed first 1000-2000 characters of crawled pages (like reading just the header)
- **After**: Now analyzes up to 15,000 characters of content for comprehensive extraction

### 2. **Structured Data Extraction**
- **Before**: Generated vague summaries and generic insights
- **After**: Extracts specific:
  - Company names with context
  - Named decision makers with titles
  - Specific English challenges
  - Actual training solutions in use
  - Employee quotes and feedback
  - Budget/investment information

### 3. **Smart Search Query Generation**
- **Before**: Used only first 3 words of objectives (e.g., "Find 10 Japanese")
- **After**: Generates 10-15 diverse, targeted queries:
  - Company-specific searches
  - Employee review platforms
  - LinkedIn for decision makers
  - Industry reports and case studies
  - Progressive refinement based on findings

### 4. **Multi-Cycle Research**
- **Before**: Single pass with generic queries
- **After**: 
  - Cycle 1: Broad discovery searches
  - Cycle 2: Deep dive into found companies
  - Cycle 3+: Target missing information

### 5. **Enhanced Reporting**
- **Before**: Listed generic insights
- **After**: Structured sections showing:
  - Specific companies with details
  - Categorized challenges
  - Named decision makers
  - Actionable intelligence

## Testing the Improvements

```bash
# Quick test of extraction capabilities
python tests/test_improved_research.py --quick

# Full research test (takes 5-10 minutes)
python tests/test_improved_research.py
```

## What to Expect Now

Instead of:
```
- Japan Dev: Japanese tech companies face English challenges
```

You'll get:
```
### Rakuten
- Context: Expanded to US market in 2024, established engineering offices
- English Challenges: 
  - "Meetings with US team difficult due to language barriers" (Glassdoor)
  - Technical documentation translation delays
- Current Solution: Berlitz corporate training program
- Decision Maker: Hiroshi Tanaka - VP of Global Talent Development
```

## Next Steps

1. Configure your Brave Search API key in `config.yaml`
2. Run the improved test to see the difference
3. Monitor the logs to see the multi-cycle research in action
4. Review the structured output report

The system now truly leverages its "overnight" advantage by going deep rather than fast!
