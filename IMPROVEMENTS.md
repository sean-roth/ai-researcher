# Recent Improvements (July 6, 2025)

## Latest Fixes (3:40 PM)

### Fixed Brave Search API Validation Errors
- **Problem**: The `brave-search` Python library was throwing validation errors because some URLs in the response didn't have `https://` prefixes
- **Solution**: Switched to direct HTTP requests using `httpx`, bypassing the strict validation
- **Result**: Brave Search now works properly and returns real search results

### Improved Extraction Prompts
- **Problem**: The LLM was returning `{"relevant_findings": false}` even on good content
- **Solution**: 
  - Made extraction prompts more explicit and instructive
  - Added clear examples of what to extract
  - Improved JSON parsing to handle extra text in responses
- **Result**: Should now extract actual company names, people, and challenges

## Major Fixes Applied Earlier

### 1. **Content Extraction Fixed**
- **Before**: Only analyzed first 1000-2000 characters of crawled pages (like reading just the header)
- **After**: Now analyzes up to 15,000 characters of content for comprehensive extraction

### 2. **Structured Data Extraction**
- **Before**: Generated vague summaries and generic insights
- **After**: Extracts specific:
  - Company names with context
  - Named decision makers with titles
  - Specific English challenges
  - Actual training solutions in use
  - Employee quotes and feedback
  - Budget/investment information

### 3. **Smart Search Query Generation**
- **Before**: Used only first 3 words of objectives (e.g., "Find 10 Japanese")
- **After**: Generates 10-15 diverse, targeted queries:
  - Company-specific searches
  - Employee review platforms
  - LinkedIn for decision makers
  - Industry reports and case studies
  - Progressive refinement based on findings

### 4. **Multi-Cycle Research**
- **Before**: Single pass with generic queries
- **After**: 
  - Cycle 1: Broad discovery searches
  - Cycle 2: Deep dive into found companies
  - Cycle 3+: Target missing information

### 5. **Enhanced Reporting**
- **Before**: Listed generic insights
- **After**: Structured sections showing:
  - Specific companies with details
  - Categorized challenges
  - Named decision makers
  - Actionable intelligence

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: We now use `httpx` for direct API calls.

### 2. Configure Brave Search
```yaml
# config.yaml
brave_search:
  api_key: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"  # Get from https://brave.com/search/api/
```

### 3. Ensure Ollama is Running
```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull dolphin3:latest  # Or your preferred model
```

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Extraction on Sample Content
```bash
python tests/test_extraction.py
```
This tests extraction on known good content to verify the LLM is working.

### Run Full Diagnostic
```bash
python tests/diagnose_pipeline.py
```
This tests each component and tells you what's working.

### Quick Test
```bash
python tests/test_improved_research.py --quick
```

### Full Research Test
```bash
python tests/test_improved_research.py
```

## What to Expect Now

Instead of:
```
Found 0 relevant sources
```

You should see:
```
Found 3 relevant sources
- Rakuten English Initiative (score: 8/10)
  Companies: ["Rakuten - Made English official language in 2010"]
  Challenges: ["Meeting productivity dropped 30-40%", "Engineers couldn't express technical concepts"]
  Solutions: ["Berlitz corporate training", "TOEIC 700+ requirement"]
  Decision Makers: ["Hiroshi Mikitani - CEO", "Yuki Sato - HR Director"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 0 Results:

1. **Check Brave Search is working**:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_extraction.py
   ```
   Look for "TESTING BRAVE SEARCH" section.

2. **Check extraction is working**:
   The same test will show if the LLM can extract from sample content.

3. **Check your model**:
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```
   Make sure the model in `config.yaml` matches an installed model.

4. **Try with more verbose logging**:
   The logs now show what's being extracted from each URL.

### Common Issues:

1. **Ollama not responding**: Make sure `ollama serve` is running
2. **Wrong model name**: Check `ollama list` for correct model name
3. **API key issues**: Get a free key from https://brave.com/search/api/

## Next Steps

The system should now:
1. Successfully search using Brave API (or fall back to good URLs)
2. Crawl and extract substantial content
3. Find specific companies, people, and challenges
4. Generate detailed reports with structured data

Run `python tests/test_extraction.py` first to verify everything is working!
