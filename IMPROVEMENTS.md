# Recent Improvements (July 6, 2025)

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. **Content Extraction Fixed**
- **Before**: Only analyzed first 1000-2000 characters of crawled pages (like reading just the header)
- **After**: Now analyzes up to 15,000 characters of content for comprehensive extraction

### 2. **Structured Data Extraction**
- **Before**: Generated vague summaries and generic insights
- **After**: Extracts specific:
  - Company names with context
  - Named decision makers with titles
  - Specific English challenges
  - Actual training solutions in use
  - Employee quotes and feedback
  - Budget/investment information

### 3. **Smart Search Query Generation**
- **Before**: Used only first 3 words of objectives (e.g., "Find 10 Japanese")
- **After**: Generates 10-15 diverse, targeted queries:
  - Company-specific searches
  - Employee review platforms
  - LinkedIn for decision makers
  - Industry reports and case studies
  - Progressive refinement based on findings

### 4. **Multi-Cycle Research**
- **Before**: Single pass with generic queries
- **After**: 
  - Cycle 1: Broad discovery searches
  - Cycle 2: Deep dive into found companies
  - Cycle 3+: Target missing information

### 5. **Enhanced Reporting**
- **Before**: Listed generic insights
- **After**: Structured sections showing:
  - Specific companies with details
  - Categorized challenges
  - Named decision makers
  - Actionable intelligence

### 6. **Brave Search API Fix** (Latest)
- **Issue**: API response structure was different than expected
- **Fix**: Now handles both dictionary and object-based responses
- **Improvement**: Better fallback URLs when Brave Search fails

### 7. **Improved Relevance Scoring**
- **Before**: Strict scoring that rejected potentially good content
- **After**: 
  - More lenient scoring for known good sources (Glassdoor, LinkedIn)
  - Better instructions to LLM for relevance checking
  - Lower threshold (5) for job boards and review sites

## Troubleshooting

### If Brave Search is failing:
```bash
# Debug the API response structure
python tests/debug_brave_search.py
```

### If no content is being extracted:
```bash
# Test with known good URLs
python tests/test_known_urls.py
```

### Common Issues:

1. **"'dict' object has no attribute 'url'" error**
   - Fixed in latest update - Brave API returns dictionaries, not objects
   
2. **Low relevance scores (all content rejected)**
   - Fixed by making relevance checking more lenient
   - Added special handling for job boards and review sites
   
3. **No companies found**
   - Check if Brave Search API key is properly configured
   - Try the fallback URLs test to ensure crawling works

## Testing the Improvements

```bash
# Quick test of extraction capabilities
python tests/test_improved_research.py --quick

# Full research test (takes 5-10 minutes)
python tests/test_improved_research.py

# Debug Brave Search API
python tests/debug_brave_search.py

# Test with known good URLs
python tests/test_known_urls.py
```

## What to Expect Now

Instead of:
```
- Japan Dev: Japanese tech companies face English challenges
```

You'll get:
```
### Rakuten
- Context: Expanded to US market in 2024, established engineering offices
- English Challenges: 
  - "Meetings with US team difficult due to language barriers" (Glassdoor)
  - Technical documentation translation delays
- Current Solution: Berlitz corporate training program
- Decision Maker: Hiroshi Tanaka - VP of Global Talent Development
```

## Configuration Checklist

1. **Brave Search API Key**
   ```yaml
   brave_search:
     api_key: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"  # Get from https://brave.com/search/api/
   ```

2. **Ollama Model**
   ```yaml
   ollama:
     model: "dolphin3:latest"  # Or your preferred model
   ```

3. **Verify Ollama is running**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Configure your Brave Search API key in `config.yaml`
2. Run `python tests/debug_brave_search.py` to verify API access
3. Run the improved test to see the difference
4. Monitor the logs to see the multi-cycle research in action
5. Review the structured output report

The system now truly leverages its "overnight" advantage by going deep rather than fast!
