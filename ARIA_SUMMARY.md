# Aria Development Summary

## What Was Built

The `aria` branch contains a complete conversational interface for the AI Researcher with the following components:

### Core Files

1. **aria.py** - Main entry point with CLI interface
   - Comprehensive help system (`/help` command)
   - Voice and text modes
   - Quick research templates
   - Real-time progress and observations
   - Command history

2. **aria_core/** - Aria-specific modules
   - **aria_personality.py** - Personality and observation system
   - **aria_voice.py** - 100% local voice I/O (Whisper + Piper/pyttsx3)
   - **templates.py** - Quick start templates for common research
   - **research_integration.py** - Connects Aria to research engine

3. **README_ARIA.md** - Complete documentation
4. **test_aria.py** - Quick test script

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Conversational Interface** - Natural language instead of YAML files
✅ **Voice Capabilities** - Optional, 100% local with multiple accent options
✅ **Personality System** - Makes observations about patterns in research
✅ **Help System** - Comprehensive `/help` with all commands documented
✅ **Quick Templates** - Fast starts for competitors, leads, grants, etc.
✅ **Real-time Updates** - See progress and observations during research
✅ **CLI Focus** - Terminal-based, no GUI needed

## How to Use

```bash
# Clone and switch to aria branch
git clone https://github.com/sean-roth/ai-researcher.git
cd ai-researcher
git checkout aria

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install rich  # For better terminal output (optional)

# For voice mode
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice pyttsx3

# Run Aria
python aria.py        # Text mode
python aria.py --voice --accent irish  # Voice mode
python aria.py --help # See all options
```

## Architecture

- **Unchanged**: Core research engine remains the same
- **New Layer**: Aria is a conversational interface on top
- **Modular**: All Aria code is in `aria_core/` directory
- **Backward Compatible**: Original `run_research.py` still works

## Next Steps

To merge to main branch:
1. Test thoroughly in both text and voice modes
2. Update main README to mention Aria option
3. Consider making Aria the default interface
4. Add migration guide for existing users

## Notes

- Voice is optional - works perfectly in text-only mode
- Observations are subtle and helpful, not distracting
- All research output still goes to `output/` directory
- Checkpoints still work for crash recovery
